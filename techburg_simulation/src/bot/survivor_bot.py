# Survivor Bots:
# - Movement and Energy:
#   Each move depletes bot energy by 5%.
#   If energy drops to 5% or below, bots consume parts immediately to restore energy.
#   Energy is restored at recharge stations; bots can also rest to regenerate at a rate of 1% per simulation step without consuming parts.
# - Carrying and Collecting:
#   Bots can carry only one part at a time.
#   Prioritize larger parts when selecting.
