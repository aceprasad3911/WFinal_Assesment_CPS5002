# Simulation Parameters:
# - Starting Conditions: Begin with a populated grid including recharge stations, survivor bots, spare parts, drones, and scavenger swarms.
# - End Conditions: Simulation ends when all spare parts are collected or corroded, or all survivor bots are eliminated without possibility of replication.

# Responsibilities:
# Manages the overall simulation loop, including initialization, updates, and termination conditions.

# Interactions:
# Coordinates interactions between Grid, Bots, RechargeStation, Drone, and ScavengerSwarm.
# Handles the simulation logic, including movement, energy depletion, and event handling.
