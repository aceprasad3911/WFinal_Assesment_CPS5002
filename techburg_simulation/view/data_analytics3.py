# 1. Bot Performance Metrics
#
# Survival Rate: Track the percentage of bots that survive over time.
#
# Reproduction Rate: Measure how many bots reproduce and the frequency of reproduction events.
#
# Energy Consumption: Analyze the energy levels of bots, including how much energy they consume versus how much they gain from food sources.


# 2. Evolutionary Metrics
#
# Genetic Diversity: Monitor the genetic variation among bots to ensure a healthy evolutionary process.
#
# Mutation Rates: Track the frequency and types of mutations occurring in the neural networks and body attributes.
#
# Fitness Scores: Calculate and display fitness scores based on survival, reproduction, and energy efficiency.


# 3. Behavioral Analytics
#
# Action Frequency: Log and analyze the frequency of different actions taken by bots (e.g., eating, attacking, moving).
#
# Interaction Metrics: Measure interactions between bots, such as attacks or cooperative behaviors.
#
# Adaptation Patterns: Identify patterns in behavior changes over generations, indicating successful adaptations.


# 4. Environmental Analytics
#
# Ecosystem Changes: Track changes in the ecosystem, such as the availability of food sources and the impact on bot behavior.
#
# Terrain Analysis: Analyze how different terrain types affect bot movement and survival strategies.
#
# Resource Distribution: Visualize the distribution of resources (plants, energy sources) in the simulation environment.


# 5. Visualization Tools
#
# Graphs and Charts: Use line graphs to show trends over time (e.g., survival rates, energy levels).
#
# Heat Maps: Create heat maps to visualize bot density and resource availability in the simulation.
#
# Simulation Replay: Implement a feature to replay simulations with visual indicators of bot actions and interactions.
