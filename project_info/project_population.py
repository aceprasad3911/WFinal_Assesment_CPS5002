# grid.py: In Progress
# Start with the Grid class, as it will likely serve as the backbone of your simulation. The grid will define the environment in which your cells and bots operate. Establishing the grid's structure and behavior first will provide a framework for the other components.

# cell.py: Completed
# Next, implement the Cell class. Each cell will represent an individual unit within the grid, and its behavior may depend on the grid's structure. Having the Cell class ready will allow you to populate the grid with cells.

# bot/ Directory: In Progres
# After the grid and cell classes are in place, you can start working on the bot classes. You might want to begin with the base class, survivor_bot.py, since other bot classes (like repair_bot.py and gatherer_bot.py) will likely inherit from it. This will allow you to establish common functionality for all bots.

# recharge_station.py:
# Implement the RechargeStation class next. This component may interact with the bots, so having it ready will help you define how bots recharge and interact with the environment.

# drone.py:
# If the drone is a significant part of your simulation, implement it next. This class may have specific behaviors that interact with the grid and other components.

# scavenger_swarm.py:
# After the main components are in place, you can implement the ScavengerSwarm class, which may depend on the grid and bot classes.

# spare_part.py:
# Implement the SparePart class, which may be used by bots or other components in the simulation.

# simulation.py:
# Once the core components are implemented, you can work on the Simulation class. This class will likely orchestrate the interactions between all the components, so itâ€™s best to do this after the foundational classes are ready.

# utils.py:
# Finally, implement any utility functions that may be needed throughout your code. These can be added as you identify specific needs during development.

# main.py:
# After the core functionality is in place, you can implement the main.py file, which will serve as the entry point for running your simulation.

# Testing Files:
# As you develop each component, consider writing corresponding tests in the tests/ directory. This will help ensure that each part of your simulation works as expected.

# Documentation:
# As you code, keep your documentation up to date. This will help you and others understand the project as it evolves.
