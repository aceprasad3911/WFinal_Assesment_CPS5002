# Notes:
# src/: This is where all the source code for your simulation will reside. Organizing your code into modules and classes will help you adhere to object-oriented design principles.
# tests/: This directory contains unit tests for your project. Using a testing framework (like unittest or pytest) will help ensure that your code is reliable and maintainable.
# docs/: Documentation is crucial for understanding the project's structure, usage, and design decisions. This is where you can include all relevant documentation.
# scripts/: Any scripts that are used to run simulations or perform data analysis can be placed here. This keeps your source directory clean and focused on the core functionality.
# requirements.txt: This file lists all the libraries your project depends on, making it easy for others to set up their environment.
# README.md: A markdown file that provides an overview of your project, including installation instructions, usage, and any other relevant information.
# .gitignore: This file specifies files and directories that should be ignored by version control (e.g., compiled files, temporary files).
# setup.py: If you want to package your project for distribution, this file will contain instructions for building and installing the package.
